## Introduction

Bitcoin has revolutionized the financial sector by introducing decentralized digital transactions. However, it has also become a target for fraudulent activities, such as money laundering and illegal trades. Detecting fraudulent transactions in a Bitcoin network poses unique challenges due to its anonymous and decentralized nature.

This project addresses these challenges by leveraging Graph Machine Learning (ML) techniques, particularly the GraphSAGE model, to classify transactions as licit or illicit. By utilizing graph structures and node features, the project provides a robust way to identify suspicious activity in transaction networks.

## Dataset Overview

The Elliptic Bitcoin Dataset forms the backbone of this project. It consists of over 200,000 Bitcoin transactions represented as a directed graph. Each transaction is labeled as:
- **Licit**: Normal transactions.
- **Illicit**: Fraudulent transactions.
- **Unknown**: Transactions with no label.

### Transaction Class Distribution

The dataset is imbalanced, with most transactions being licit and a small proportion labeled as illicit. Understanding this distribution is crucial for addressing class imbalance in model training.

### Temporal Analysis

Fraudulent activities often exhibit temporal patterns. Analyzing the frequency of transactions over time can help identify anomalies or bursts of illicit activity.

## Graph Structure Analysis

### Transaction Network Visualization

The graph structure of Bitcoin transactions reveals connectivity patterns. Fraud rings or tightly linked fraudulent nodes often form dense subgraphs, while licit transactions are more randomly distributed.

### Node Degree Distribution

Nodes with unusually high degrees often act as transaction hubs, which can be either central fraud players or legitimate exchange points. Analyzing the degree distribution helps identify these influential nodes.

## Feature Analysis

### Feature Correlation Heatmap

Correlation analysis between features helps identify relationships, redundancy, and informative variables. Strong correlations might indicate features that carry similar information, while weak correlations suggest unique predictors.

### PCA of Features

Reducing the dataset's dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows for visualization of transaction clusters in a 2D space. Illicit transactions often form distinguishable clusters due to unique patterns.

## GraphSAGE Model

### Model Workflow

GraphSAGE learns node embeddings by aggregating information from neighboring nodes in a scalable way. This method captures local and global graph structures, which are critical for detecting fraudulent transactions.

### Layer Aggregation

The multi-layer aggregation process in GraphSAGE enables the model to learn hierarchical relationships between nodes and their neighbors. This helps in identifying indirect influences, such as cascades of fraudulent activity.

## Results and Analysis

### Node Embedding Visualization

The embeddings generated by GraphSAGE map nodes into a vector space where licit and illicit transactions form separate clusters. This shows the effectiveness of the model in capturing meaningful patterns.

### Prediction Scores Heatmap

The heatmap of prediction scores provides insights into the model's confidence in classifying each transaction. High confidence in identifying illicit transactions is a key indicator of the model's success.

## Conclusion and Future Work

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Graph Machine Learning techniques, specifically GraphSAGE, for detecting fraudulent Bitcoin transactions. Future work could focus on:
- Expanding the dataset to improve model generalization.
- Incorporating explainability methods for regulatory compliance.
- Adapting the model for real-time fraud detection.
